**Rune Sperre**  

---
I'm a developer for Innovation Norway in Stavanger, Norway.  
I have been working as a SharePoint developer/consultant/advisor/architect since 2009, these days exclusivly with Microsoft 365. 

Contributing to the [Microsoft 365 Platform Community](http://aka.ms/sppnp), so should you!
  
I also try to help out at [SharePoint StackExchange](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/), some of my posts will be longer versions of answers provided there.


Examples of topics I *might* want to touch in this blog:
  * SharePoint Framework (SPFx)
  * Adaptive Cards (ACEs)
  * Azure Functions
  * PowerShell
  * List formatting
  * Random ramblings
