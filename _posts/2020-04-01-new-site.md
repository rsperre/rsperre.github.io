This was asked as a question on [SharePoint Stack Exchange](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/) but was removed before I had a chance to answer it. This is also why I thought: "Hey, maybe I should create a blog?"

The question was along the lines of:
    
    Why are there different commands to create new sites in SharePoint?
    New-PnPSite, New-PnPTenantSite, New-SPOSite? 

First difference: The commands belong to different sets of libraries:

`New-PnPSite` and `New-PnPTenantSite` is part of the [Patterns and Practices PowerShell Library][1]  
`New-SPOSite` belongs to the [SharePoint Online Management Shell][2].

New-SPOSite and New-PnPTenantSite will both create a classic Site Collection that is **not** connected to an Office 365 Group. These will also show up in the classic Site Collection overview in the SharePoint administration center.

New-PnPSite will either create a communication site or an Office 365 Group connected team site. These are often referred to as a "Modern Sites".
