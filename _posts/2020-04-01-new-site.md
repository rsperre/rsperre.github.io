This was asked as a question on [SharePoint Stack Exchange](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/) but was removed before I had a chance to answer it.

The question was along the lines of:
    
> Why are there different commands to create new sites in SharePoint?  
> New-PnPSite, New-PnPTenantSite, New-SPOSite... What's the difference?

### First difference: The commands belong to different sets of libraries:

`New-PnPSite` and `New-PnPTenantSite` is part of the [Patterns and Practices PowerShell Library][1]  
This is a widely used open source library that mainly uses CSOM to manage SharePoint (supports both Online and On-Premise). 

`New-SPOSite` belongs to the [SharePoint Online Management Shell][2].  
This is Microsofts management shell, used to manage tenant and site collection level settings. Compared to PnP Powershell it is quite limited in functionality - you also have to connect to the tenant admin center to run the commands.

### There are different types of Site Collections:

New-SPOSite and New-PnPTenantSite will both create a classic Site Collection that is **not** connected to an Office 365 Group. These will also show up in the classic Site Collection overview in the SharePoint administration center.

New-PnPSite will either create a communication site or an Office 365 Group connected team site. These are still often referred to as "Modern Sites".

### Why does this matter? 
Well, to bring it back to the starting question: It depends on what you need.

**Communication Sites and Classic Team Sites**  
The permissions for these two are handled entierly through the good old SharePoint membership groups. 

**Team Sites**  
In addition to the standard SharePoint Membership groups, these sites have a corresponding Office 365 Group that handles the permissions. These have Owners and Members. If you look a bit behind the scenes you can see that these are mapped to the SharePoint Groups:

![Hmm](/images/permissions-01.png)
*This can be a bit confusing. It seems like this site has no owners!*

![Hmm](/images/permissions-02.png)
*PowerShell to the rescue. We can see that the owners of the Office 365 group are members of this group - note the **_o** at the end of the loginname.*

## Summary

If you want the same kind of sites you can get by pressing "New" on SharePoint home, go for New-PnPSite. This lets you create both Communication Sites and the Team Sites of 2020.

If you need a classic site collection, without it being part of an Office 365 Group, use New-PnPTenantSite or New-SPOSite.
